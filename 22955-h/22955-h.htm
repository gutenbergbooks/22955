<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD</h2>



<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> tradition regarding Jesus is so glamorous that it
is difficult to review his life and character with an unbiased
mind. While Fundamentalists and Modernists
differ regarding the divinity of Christ, all Christians
and many non-Christians still cling to preconceived
notions of the perfection of Jesus. He alone among men
is revered as all-loving, omniscient, faultless&mdash;an unparalleled
model for mankind.</p>

<p>This convention of the impeccability of Jesus is so
firmly established that any insinuation of error on his
part is deemed a blasphemy. Doubting Jesus is more
impious than mocking God Almighty. Jehovah may be
exposed to some extent with impunity; a God who destroyed
70,000 of his chosen people because their king
took a census<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> is too illogical for any but theologians to
worship. But the Son of God, or Son of man, is sacrosanct.
Jesus is reverenced as the one man who has lived
unspotted by the world, free from human foibles, able
to redeem mankind by his example.</p>

<p>Respect for the principles of Jesus is so inbred in
American people of all faiths that an attempt to disparage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
his worth is denounced as bad taste. The detractor
is suspected of being an immoral person, no matter
how convincing may be the proof which he presents.
A conspiracy of silence is directed against any system
of ethics advanced as superior to the Sermon on the
Mount. In popular opinion Jesus never made a mistake;
all his teachings were infallible; no other view is
tolerated.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Face_the_Facts" id="Face_the_Facts"></a>Face the Facts</p>

<p>This unwillingness to acknowledge the shortcomings
of Jesus is partially due to fear of sustaining a great loss.
The familiar answer to heretical arguments is that faith
should not be destroyed unless something can be put
in its place&mdash;ignoring the fact that something always
may be substituted for beliefs destroyed. That substitute
is faith in the world as it really is. And our modern
world, with all its shortcomings, is infinitely preferable
to the earth, or even the heaven, of the first century.
We now know that man can do more to eradicate sorrow
than Jesus ever thought of. We can have greater confidence
in the world as revealed today than in the doubtful
traditions of Biblical times.</p>

<p>But suppose there were nothing to substitute for the
myth destroyed, should that deter the Truthseeker from
continuing his investigation? Scientists do not hesitate
in their research because the result of a new discovery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
may be disastrous. They seek the facts regardless of
consequences; they want to know the Truth about the
physical world. Ethicists should have a similar desire
concerning the metaphysical world. They should have
confidence that the Supreme Intelligence (as Edison
called it) will lead on to better things.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="The_True_Jesus" id="The_True_Jesus"></a>The True Jesus</p>

<p>If Jesus was what his followers believe, no arguments
will destroy their faith in him; but if Jesus was
not perfect, according to modern standards, it is important
that his status as God, or man, should be
revised. Loss of confidence in an erring idol is not loss
of a true ideal.</p>

<p>When an iconoclast asserts that Jesus lacked supreme
intelligence, the natural question is, "How do
you know that you are right in your appraisal, 'lest
haply ye be found even to fight against God'?" The
answer is that we do not claim omniscience, but merely
request everyone to use his or her own judgment, with
intellectual honesty, examining each act or saying of
Jesus without regard to presupposed ideas or tradition.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Scriptures_Unauthentic" id="Scriptures_Unauthentic"></a>Scriptures Unauthentic</p>

<p>The consensus of scholarship has rejected the creation
of the universe in six days in 4004 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, science<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
having proved the existence of the world for millions of
years. Higher Critics refuse to credit the book of Genesis,
according to the first chapter of which the trees,
beasts and fowls were created before man, but according
to the second chapter after man. It is not assuming
too much for the humblest writer to say that Moses
was mistaken concerning many things he described in
the Pentateuch. It follows that if one important portion
of the Bible is untrustworthy, other parts of that
same book may not be the infallible Word of God. The
New Testament, as well as the Old, may be examined
critically, and if the gospels contain numerous contradictions,
the statements of the authors on any point, including
the life of Jesus, are open to question. A
conscientious person should reach conclusions based
upon the best knowledge obtainable from all sources.</p>

<p>If anyone is convinced that Jesus made mistakes, he
is not necessarily compelled to become an atheist. All
other Gods that have been worshipped by men have
been found imperfect. The oft exposed errors of Jehovah
do not prevent Christians and Jews from professing
belief in God. Those who require support from outside
themselves cling to the symbol of deity though not
thoroughly crediting any personality ever described in
any sacred scriptures. Except Jesus.</p>

<p>An Evolutionist passes beyond the negative denial
of God to the construction of a new philosophy in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Truth is his guide, Truth being the nearest approximation
to reality obtainable with our present knowledge.
Belief in the world as it is now, and as it is going to be,
is a sufficient creed.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Faith_in_Jesus" id="Faith_in_Jesus"></a>Faith in Jesus</p>

<p>With Jesus entrenched in popular opinion, there is
small probability that faith in him will be shaken unless
there is a preponderance of evidence against his
divinity. No one need abandon faith in Jesus until
convinced that something better has been found. No
one should even expose himself to heretical arguments
unless he is a devotee of Truth. Then only can he
rejoice at a revelation of error in confidence that the
more nearly the universe is understood the better can
man adjust himself to his surroundings. A worshipper
of Truth fears no destruction of false gods, nor any facts
that may cause him to throw over treasured superstitions.
He is willing to prove all things and hold fast to
that which is true. He rejoices when his idol is shattered,
knowing that he is approaching nearer to the true way
of living, a way that Jesus did not adequately explain.</p>

<p>Any attempt to censure the character of Jesus will
meet with the ridicule it deserves unless substantiated
by documentary evidence. The mere improbability of
events contrary to natural laws does not destroy the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
ethical value of the teachings of the Nazarene. Anything
might have happened in the eerie days of old;
the critic must do more than deny the historicity of
Jesus and the inspiration of the Bible. To be convincing
he must derive from the scriptures in which Christians
believe whatever proof can be deduced to unveil the
superstition of a redeeming Savior.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Documentary_Evidence" id="Documentary_Evidence"></a>Documentary Evidence</p>

<p>The documents most generally accepted by Christians
are those collected in the King James Version of
the Bible. The Apocrypha and other early manuscripts
are unreliable. None of the thirty or more writers who
described events around Jerusalem in Jesus' time gives
any account of his teachings. The only life of Jesus is
found in the four gospels; the numerous biographers of
Christ have had no other reliable source of information.
It is deceptive for the publishers of revised editions of
the Bible to claim that "original manuscripts" have
been consulted. Not one of the original manuscripts is
in existence, the earliest extant dating from the fourth
century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, while the most ancient portion of the New
Testament in any museum was transcribed in the sixth
century.</p>

<p>Accepting, therefore, the King James Version of the
New Testament as the most reliable source of information,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the question arises as to what portion of the chapters
therein may be considered authentic. Scholars have
rejected the entire gospel of John as less reliable than
the synoptic gospels; and the sixteenth chapter of
Mark as an addition after the original papyrus had
broken off. Modernists, being confronted, in spite of
these deletions, with inconsistencies in the gospels of
Matthew, Mark and Luke, have assumed the further
privilege of rejecting any verses which appear at variance
with their beliefs. Liberals of this class contend
that the supernatural side of Jesus may be disregarded
and yet that Jesus will remain Our Lord. They reject
certain evangelistic passages that conflict with modern
thought, but accept other statements by the same authors
as authoritative.</p>

<p>As the Christian churches have not accepted any abbreviation
of the Bible as a substitute for the King
James Version, it seems proper for the critic to have
recourse to that translation as the most authentic description
of the life and teachings of Jesus. He is justified,
moreover, in considering every word in the supposedly
inspired gospels as equally reliable. His only
concern should be to interpret each verse as nearly as
possible as the original writers intended their words to
be understood, allowing for Eastern hyperbole and the
custom of the times.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Retain_the_Good" id="Retain_the_Good"></a>Retain the Good</p>

<p>In preparing a critical analysis of the character of
Jesus, it is freely admitted that many of the thoughts
attributed to the son of Mary are superlatively fine.
They will live forever whether the personality of Jesus
be rejected as a divinity or not. That these beautiful
preachments are ignored here is not due to any desire
to belittle admirable sentiments or to disparage right
living. The loving side of Jesus has been emphasized
again and again and will be borne in mind by the reader
when other less admirable traits are criticized. The intent
of this criticism is not to destroy idealism but to
assist the spirit of true progress.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Christianity_Must_Go" id="Christianity_Must_Go"></a>Christianity Must Go</p>

<p>The significance of this investigation lies in the
changes that would have to be made in religious
thought if it should be found that Jesus was not perfect.
If Jesus was in error concerning conditions of his own
time and exhibited no knowledge of our modern problems,
his authority will be lessened. Searchers after the
true way of life will not continue to worship a person
whose conception of the physical and spiritual world
was erroneous. If Jesus made mistakes, he is neither the
Son of God nor an infallible man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>So long as people feel compelled to worship what has
been proved imperfect, or to evade important doctrines
of their creeds for fear of losing faith in old traditions,
their minds will not be receptive to changes in social
conditions that require abandonment of established customs.
Christians are imbued with a psychology derived
from a completed revelation. The firmer their belief in
Jesus, the greater their resistance to new ideas. Catholics
are more reluctant to join progressive movements than
Modernists and Modernists than Evolutionists. Religious
people are apt to be afraid of the new world; they
doubt the possibility of eliminating war, poverty and
injustice&mdash;customs as deeply rooted in the social world
as belief in Jesus is in the religious world. If the chief
reactionary bulwark of the past is abandoned, there will
be greater possibility of accepting new revelations.</p>

<p>What would happen if Christians should discover
that their leader was not an incomparable guide? Absolutely
nothing at first. Those accustomed to lead a
moral life would continue to do so. Members of Christian
churches are the very people who most wish to do
what is right. They will not lose their character because
Jesus has lost his fictitious divinity. On the contrary,
they will search for the most elevating principles to
substitute for the personality that has been found deficient.
It is difficult for people to be superior to their
gods. These same church-going individuals, when freed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
from the fetters of antiquated supernaturalism, will
gradually learn to serve mankind with the same devotion
they now render to a misunderstood God. They
will no longer be limited by the defects of their paragon
in their efforts to make the most of life. They will seek
to solve modern problems in a rational way instead of
deciding such matters as birth control, divorce, war and
prohibition by reference to the scriptures, as they do
now. For the first time they will make their decisions
according to the best knowledge obtainable today.</p>

<p>Jesus was in advance of his time. He declared that
such revengeful theories as an eye for an eye must be
supplanted by forgiveness. But as the world has evolved,
Jesus has stood still. His teachings, superior as they
were to those of the ancient Israelites, are now found to
be inferior to the best ethics culled from the wisdom of
the ages, brought down to date. It is heartening to feel
that we can appropriate the superlative principles of all
time instead of worshipping a deified personality who
was limited to the best that men of his own generation
could conceive.</p>

<p>This examination of the life and character of Jesus
will be based upon the accounts in the New Testament.
Each passage will be construed as appears to the writer
to have been originally intended. The reader may substitute
his own interpretation, but should in no instance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
pass lightly over a situation as immaterial. Every word
or action of Jesus is an important link in the chain of
his divinity, or of his exalted position as a moral guide.
Each argument should be met by acceptance or rejection,
never with indifference. No reader of the following
pages should ever say, "What difference does it make?"
Everything concerning Jesus is of vast consequence in
determining whether he is or is not a divine Savior, or a
perfect guide.</p>

<h2><a name="ANTIQUATED_THEOLOGY" id="ANTIQUATED_THEOLOGY"></a>ANTIQUATED THEOLOGY</h2>



<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> first event in the life of Jesus, the gospel story of
his birth, is now considered unauthentic by many
scholars and some theologians. The birth of a virgin,
the visitation of an angel, the star in the East are phenomena
contrary to natural laws and rest on insufficient
authority for acceptance as credible. The probabilities
are against exceptions in the laws of the universe.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="The_Virgin_Birth" id="The_Virgin_Birth"></a>The Virgin Birth</p>

<p>The original evidence for the virgin birth is found
only in the gospels of Matthew and Luke, two unknown
historians, and both these evangelists implicitly
deny their own tale when they trace the descent of
Jesus from David through Joseph.<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The slaughter of the
children by Herod, in fear of Jesus as a rival, probably
never took place. Mark, Luke and John do not mention
it; Josephus, who dwelt on the crimes of Herod, knew
nothing of this massacre. According to Luke, Mary and
Joseph took Jesus to Jerusalem openly soon after the
supposed decree.<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p><p>There is dispute as to whether Jesus was born in
Bethlehem or Nazareth, and the date of his birth has
been placed anywhere from 4 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> to 7 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> Matthew
says that Jesus was born "in the days of Herod", while
Luke says it was "When Cyrenius was governor of
Syria." Herod died in 4 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, while Cyrenius did not
become governor of Syria until 7 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></p>

<p>The romantic story of the Christ-child is not corroborated
by the historians of the time and is in opposition
to the theory of evolution by natural processes.
And yet it is still one of the main sources of Jesus' fame,
being repeated at Christmas-tide in the churches, thus
connecting Jesus with God in a superhuman manner.</p>

<p>The consensus of scholarship is in practical agreement
that the theory of the virgin birth as a link
between Jesus and God is a mistake; but whose mistake
was it? Jesus never referred to his miraculous birth. If
he was merely a man and never heard of the rumor
about his conception, he was not to blame for the
spread of this misleading story throughout Christendom.</p>

<p>While Jesus did not refer to his divine paternity in
a physical sense, he did endeavor to convince his hearers
that he was more directly connected with God than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
other men. "I and my Father are one."<a name="FNanchor_3_4" id="FNanchor_3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_4" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> "No man
knoweth the Son but the Father; neither knoweth any
man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever
the Son will reveal him."<a name="FNanchor_4_5" id="FNanchor_4_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_5" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Jesus thus proclaimed himself identical with the Lord
God of the Old Testament who called himself Jehovah.
This is entirely in keeping with the whole Christian
theory, for the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of Jesus derived from the
act of God soon after the creation. Adam and Eve ate
of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil which God had commanded them not to touch, and
for this disobedience, this fall of man from grace, God
cursed mankind. Jesus came to earth to save man from
the wrath of Almighty God.</p>

<p>But this claim of Jesus to oneness with God renders
him liable to censure for the acts of Jehovah which represented
a standard of ethics inferior to that preached

concepts of primitive men.<a name="FNanchor_16_17" id="FNanchor_16_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_17" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>While Jesus could read<a name="FNanchor_17_18" id="FNanchor_17_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_18" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and was familiar with the
scriptures, it is possible that he was not acquainted with
the system of dictatorship formerly employed by his
Father. Occasionally Jesus denounced the ethics of
"them of old time", but he always referred to his
Father as perfect.</p>

<p>The dilemma is that Jesus must be condemned either
for claiming identity with Jehovah (to whom he was
really superior), or for accepting with only slight improvements
the tyranny of God as described in the
Bible, the Word of God. Of course if the Bible is not
the Word of God, the whole system of Christian
theology falls to the ground.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="The_Jewish_Messiah" id="The_Jewish_Messiah"></a>The Jewish Messiah</p>

<p>Jesus claimed to be the Messiah expected by the Jews.
"And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure
thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether
thou be the Christ, the Son of God. Jesus saith unto
him, Thou hast said."<a name="FNanchor_18_19" id="FNanchor_18_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_19" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> "Again the high priest asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son
of the Blessed? And Jesus said, I am."<a name="FNanchor_19_20" id="FNanchor_19_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_20" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> "Then said
they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said
unto them, Ye say that I am."<a name="FNanchor_20_21" id="FNanchor_20_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_21" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> "The woman saith
unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called
Christ: when he is come he will tell us all things. Jesus
saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he."<a name="FNanchor_21_22" id="FNanchor_21_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_22" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>These acknowledgments by Jesus that he was the
Messiah are important, for if he claimed divinity when
he was merely mortal, either under false pretences or
being self-deceived, he made a mistake of the most
serious character. His claim was not recognized by his
own people, and many of his followers today deny that
he was the Jewish Messiah. Jesus said that he came
from God to save the Jews. Either he was truly the
predicted Messiah or he made an inexcusable error. In
this as in other instances to be cited, Fundamentalists
will not admit any mistake, for they believe in the
supernatural events connected with the Son of God. But
Modernists, who reject the anointed Christ while clinging
to the human Jesus, may be at a loss to reconcile
Jesus' claim to Messiahship with their rejection of his
divinity.</p>

<p>Jesus stressed his mission to save the world, saying
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not
perish, but have everlasting life."<a name="FNanchor_22_23" id="FNanchor_22_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_23" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Eternal_Damnation" id="Eternal_Damnation"></a>Eternal Damnation</p>

<p>Whether Jesus was mistaken or not in his estimate of
his close relationship with God is for each person to decide;
but his theory of the disasters that would follow
unbelief in his divinity leads to serious difficulties if accepted
literally. For not only was Jesus in error when
he insisted that salvation depended upon belief, he was
also reconciled to eternal suffering for unbelievers. Note
some of his expressions:</p>

<p>"If ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your
sins."<a name="FNanchor_23_24" id="FNanchor_23_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_24" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting
fire, prepared for the devil and his angels ... And
these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but
the righteous into life eternal."<a name="FNanchor_24_25" id="FNanchor_24_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_25" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>"Whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost
hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal
damnation."<a name="FNanchor_25_26" id="FNanchor_25_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_26" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>"Except ye repent ye shall perish."<a name="FNanchor_26_27" id="FNanchor_26_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_27" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>"If thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for
thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be
quenched."<a name="FNanchor_27_28" id="FNanchor_27_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_28" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>"How can ye escape the damnation of hell?"<a name="FNanchor_28_29" id="FNanchor_28_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_29" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>"He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but
he that believeth not shall be damned."<a name="FNanchor_29_30" id="FNanchor_29_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_30" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>It is evident from these quotations that Jesus not only
preached belief in his divinity as essential to salvation,
but endeavored to terrify people into belief by threats
of eternal torment. Jesus was responsible for the theological
conception of a fiery hell. If he was mistaken, if
there never was a place of torment for the wicked after
death, is it not an act of constructive criticism to expose
the person most responsible for the false doctrine that
has caused so much fear and mental suffering? Must
we not deplore this mistake of Jesus and recast our entire
opinion of him as a religious teacher?</p>

<p>Are we not justified in stating positively that Jesus
made a mistake when he taught a physical hell and
condemned people to spend eternity in torment for the
doubtful sin of disbelief?</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="The_Atonement" id="The_Atonement"></a>The Atonement</p>

<p>The doctrine of the Atonement was taught by Jesus.
"For this is my blood of the new testament, which is
shed for many for the remission of sins."<a name="FNanchor_30_31" id="FNanchor_30_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_31" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p>Whether this sacrifice of the innocent Jesus to save
sinful man was ordered by God or was voluntary on the
part of Jesus, it represents a theory of reprieve from
punishment long since abandoned as unethical. If sin
must be punished, there is no justice in relieving the
sinner and placing the burden upon the righteous.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Atonement appears to have been ineffective,
for in spite of the sacrifice that Jesus made,
few were to be saved under his scheme of salvation.
"Many are called but few are chosen."<a name="FNanchor_31_32" id="FNanchor_31_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_32" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> "Strait is the
gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life,
and few there be that find it."<a name="FNanchor_32_33" id="FNanchor_32_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_33" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> "Strive to enter in at
the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to
enter in, and shall not be able."<a name="FNanchor_33_34" id="FNanchor_33_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_34" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>If the theory of Atonement for sin by the sacrifice of
the innocent was not ethical and if Jesus taught that
doctrine, he was in error, was he not?</p>

<p>The sacrifice of Jesus was not so great as often made
by men. Jesus was sustained with the thought that he
was saving the world; his physical suffering was not
long continued; on the night of his crucifixion he was
in paradise.<a name="FNanchor_34_35" id="FNanchor_34_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_35" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> He endured a few hours of pain compared
to weeks of suffering by wounded soldiers, or years
spent in prison by the proponents of an ideal.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p>Jesus not only claimed the power to remit sins but
also said to his disciples: "Whosoever sins ye remit,
they are remitted unto them; and whosoever sins ye
retain, they are retained."<a name="FNanchor_35_36" id="FNanchor_35_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_36" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Is that true? Surely it is proper to ask that blunt
question. Here is a definite statement concerning the
power of certain men to remit sins. If those men did not
have the power deputed to them, must we not doubt
the accuracy of Jesus?</p>

<p>Jesus made a distinction between himself and the
Comforter: "It is expedient for you that I go away: for
if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you;
but if I depart I will send him unto you ... And I
will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
Comforter, that he may abide with you forever."<a name="FNanchor_36_37" id="FNanchor_36_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_37" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>It must surprise some Christians that the Comforter
could not be present at the same time with Jesus.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Angels_and_Devils" id="Angels_and_Devils"></a>Angels and Devils</p>

<p>Jesus believed in angels and devils, often referring to
these imaginary supernatural beings as if they existed.
"Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father
and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of angels?"<a name="FNanchor_37_38" id="FNanchor_37_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_38" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> "So shall it be at the end of the world:
the angels shall come forth."<a name="FNanchor_38_39" id="FNanchor_38_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_39" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The devils were among the first to recognize Christ's
divinity: "What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou
Son of God?"<a name="FNanchor_39_40" id="FNanchor_39_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_40" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> "Let us alone, thou Jesus of Nazareth;
art thou come to destroy us? I know thee, who thou
art, the Holy One of God."<a name="FNanchor_40_41" id="FNanchor_40_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_41" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> "And unclean spirits
when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried,
saying, Thou art the Son of God."<a name="FNanchor_41_42" id="FNanchor_41_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_42" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Jesus believed in demoniacal possession, casting out
devils on several occasions.</p>

<p>Jesus frequently referred to heaven as a place above
the earth: "And then shall they see the Son of man
coming in the clouds with great power and glory."<a name="FNanchor_42_43" id="FNanchor_42_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_43" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
"And ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right
hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven."<a name="FNanchor_43_44" id="FNanchor_43_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_44" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
"Verily, verily, I say unto you, hereafter ye shall see
heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending
on the Son of man."<a name="FNanchor_44_45" id="FNanchor_44_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_45" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>When Jesus was transfigured and talked with Moses
and Elias, he charged his disciples, saying, "Tell the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again
from the dead."<a name="FNanchor_45_46" id="FNanchor_45_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_46" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>According to the creeds based upon the Bible, Jesus
rose from the dead, descended into hell, and ascended
bodily into heaven. According to the gospels he stilled
the storm, walked on the water and told Peter to do so
and to find money in a fish's mouth and catch a large
draught of fishes. These and other miracles connected
Jesus with God and were part of his theology.</p>

<p>Every fair-minded person should re-read the gospels
and refresh his memory regarding the theology of Jesus.
Then a decision must be reached as to the correctness
of the views expressed. Either conditions on earth were
different in the first century from those of the twentieth,
or Jesus was mistaken in his conception of God, heaven,
hell, angels, devils and himself.</p>

<p>Jesus was confident that the day of judgment was
coming in the first century, but it has not come yet,
nineteen hundred years later. This erroneous belief in
the imminent end of the world had an important bearing
upon his entire philosophy; for if the end of the
world was so near it was far more important to prepare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
for life hereafter than to be concerned over mundane
affairs. May we not view with doubt any of Jesus'
teachings that depended upon his mistaken conception
of the duration of the world?</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Miracles" id="Miracles"></a>Miracles</p>

<p>Jesus is reported to have fed 5,000 people with five
loaves and two fishes, and again 4,000 with seven
loaves and a few small fishes. He walked on the water,
calmed the seas, raised three persons from the dead
and performed other miracles contrary to natural laws.
These wondrous acts were depended upon by him to
convince the people that he was the expected Messiah:
"Go and shew John again those things which ye do
hear and see: the blind receive their sight, and the lame
walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the
dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel
preached to them."<a name="FNanchor_10_56" id="FNanchor_10_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_56" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Jesus assured his disciples that they too would be able
to perform miracles: "And these signs shall follow them
that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they
shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents;
and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not
hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they
shall recover."<a name="FNanchor_11_57" id="FNanchor_11_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_57" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> "He that believeth on me, the works<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these
shall he do."<a name="FNanchor_12_58" id="FNanchor_12_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_58" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Jesus set great store by these marvels that only magicians
attempt nowadays. Ministers of the apostolic
succession cannot cast out devils or take up serpents,
and they are affected by deadly drinks the same as
others. Jesus had a primitive idea of the value of such
magic. Either he sought to deceive the gullible, or, as is
more likely, was himself overcredulous. It is important
to remember that Jesus stressed the value of enchantment
and advised his successors to conjure in his name.</p>

<p>If the miraculous had not been connected with the
name of Jesus, it is probable that he never would have
been heard of. His ethical teachings alone would not
have won for him the exalted position that has come
from the stories of his miraculous birth, life and ascension.
In other words, his fame rests upon the supernatural
side of his life that is now discredited by many
of his followers.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Eternal_Life" id="Eternal_Life"></a>Eternal Life</p>

<p>The remarks of Jesus on the subject of death were
not accurate. "If a man keep my saying, he shall never
see death."<a name="FNanchor_13_59" id="FNanchor_13_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_59" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> "Whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die."<a name="FNanchor_14_60" id="FNanchor_14_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_60" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p><p>Apparently Jesus referred to natural death, in which
case he was utterly mistaken; but if he meant that believers
in him should live forever in heaven, even so he
gave a false impression; for there is no evidence that
life after death is assured to Christians more than to
others. Unbelievers were also to have eternal life,
though in torment.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Raising_Lazarus" id="Raising_Lazarus"></a>Raising Lazarus</p>

<p>Jesus took advantage of opportunities, even of death,
to create dramatic effects. The eleventh chapter of John
shows that when Lazarus was reported ill, Jesus said,
"This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of
God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby."
So Jesus let Lazarus, one of the believers whom he loved,
die<a name="FNanchor_15_61" id="FNanchor_15_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_61" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> in order that he might have the triumph of raising
him from the dead. "Then said Jesus unto them
plainly, Lazarus is dead. And I am glad for your sakes
that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe."</p>

<p>The confusion between earthly death and loss of
eternal life was shown in the remark of Jesus to Martha:
"I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in
me, though he were dead, yet shall he live." This might
be construed to mean that believers should have eternal
life hereafter, but Jesus evidently had reference to life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
on earth for he proceeded to raise Lazarus from the dead
and cause him to live again on earth with his sisters.</p>

<p>When Martha reminded Jesus that Lazarus had been
dead four days, Jesus replied, "Said I not unto thee,
that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the
glory of God?" But Jesus himself had doubts of his
ability to bring back Lazarus to life, as shown by his
spontaneous prayer of thanks: "Father, I thank thee
that thou hast heard me." Then he revealed again his
desire to dramatize the occasion, saying, "And I knew
that thou hearest me always: but because of the people
which stand by I said it, that they may believe that
thou hast sent me."</p>

<p>"Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and
had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him."
Do the followers of Jesus, who claim that he made no
mistakes, believe on him? If so, they must believe that
he raised Lazarus from the dead as he claimed to have
done. Do they believe that they can also raise people
from the dead? Jesus so assured them when he promised
that believers could do greater works than he performed.
No, Jesus gave a false impression of his power.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Gods_Protection" id="Gods_Protection"></a>God's Protection</p>

<p>Jesus continued his deception of the world by promising
protection that has never been accorded. "Are not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
two sparrows sold for a farthing? And one of them shall
not fall on the ground without your Father. But the
very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not
therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows."<a name="FNanchor_16_62" id="FNanchor_16_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_62" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>These sayings may properly be taken as symbolical
or allegorical; but the evident intention was to assure
his followers that God would protect them in their daily
life. Safety was promised for believers, a safety that has
been lacking for everyone. There is no evidence that
God does protect believers any more than unbelievers.
When the Titanic went down, those who perished were
not solely the wicked persons; there was no distinction
in the terrible disaster between believers and unbelievers.</p>

<p>Jesus created in the minds of his hearers and his followers
the idea that God was watching each individual
to save him from danger, but this, unfortunately, is not
a fact. It sounds comforting; it makes people feel nearer
to God; but experience proves that no such close relationship
exists. Jesus gave a false impression of God's
loving care for men.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Belief_in_Prayer" id="Belief_in_Prayer"></a>Belief in Prayer</p>

<p>Modern religious people may still consistently believe
in prayer as a form of inward aspiration, but it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
difficult to take literally the assurance given by Jesus of
practical accomplishments by means of prayer in his
name.</p>

<p>Jesus did not confine himself to promising spiritual
results from prayer, but distinctly gave it to be understood
that the physical world would respond to petitions
to Jehovah. "Again I say unto you, That if two of you
shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they
shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which
is in heaven."<a name="FNanchor_17_63" id="FNanchor_17_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_63" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> "If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye
shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but
also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed,
and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.
And all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer,
believing, ye shall receive."<a name="FNanchor_18_64" id="FNanchor_18_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_64" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> "What things soever
ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them,
and ye shall have them."<a name="FNanchor_19_65" id="FNanchor_19_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_65" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> "If ye have faith as a grain
of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain,
Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove:
and nothing shall be impossible unto you."<a name="FNanchor_20_66" id="FNanchor_20_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_66" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>These promises have not been fulfilled. Bishops,
priests and deacons with strong faith have been unable
to obtain, by means of the most sincere prayer, results<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
similar to those indicated. They have followed Jesus
in vain. No man living dare put his faith to the test by
a public demonstration of prayer for physical changes.
Christian prayers for rain are conventional, not being
offered with confidence that rain will follow.</p>

<p>Jesus has misled us.</p>

<h2><a name="OBSCURE_TEACHINGS" id="OBSCURE_TEACHINGS"></a>OBSCURE TEACHINGS</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Many</span> of the sayings of Jesus lacked clarity. Various
interpretations have been put upon them by scholars of
distinction. No one is sure what was meant.</p>

<p>According to the gospels, Jesus was descended from
David, but Jesus mystified his hearers on this descent,
saying: "If David then call him Lord, how is he his
son?"<a name="FNanchor_1_67" id="FNanchor_1_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_67" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Witnesses_and_Judge" id="Witnesses_and_Judge"></a>Witnesses and Judge</p>

<p>On the subject of witnesses there is great confusion.
"If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true."<a name="FNanchor_2_68" id="FNanchor_2_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_68" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
"Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is
true."<a name="FNanchor_3_69" id="FNanchor_3_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_69" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> "It is also written in your law, that the testimony
of two men is true. I am one that bear witness of
myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of
me."<a name="FNanchor_4_70" id="FNanchor_4_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_70" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> "I and my Father are one."<a name="FNanchor_5_71" id="FNanchor_5_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_71" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> "My Father is
greater than I."<a name="FNanchor_6_72" id="FNanchor_6_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_72" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>This and the following instruction regarding judicial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
procedure are far from clear. Jesus acknowledged the
principle of law requiring more than one witness but
said that in his case the only other witness necessary was
his Father, although he and his Father were one.</p>

<p>Jesus is supposed to be the judge of the world, but
his statement of the case leaves the issue ambiguous.
"For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed
all judgment unto the Son."<a name="FNanchor_7_73" id="FNanchor_7_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_73" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> "I judge no man. And
yet if I judge, my judgment is true."<a name="FNanchor_8_74" id="FNanchor_8_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_74" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> "And if any
man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not:
for I came not to judge the world, but to save the
world."<a name="FNanchor_9_75" id="FNanchor_9_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_75" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> "For judgment I am come into this world,
that they which see not might see; and that they which
see might be made blind."<a name="FNanchor_10_76" id="FNanchor_10_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_76" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The quality of reasoning employed in these instances
has naturally led to theological quibbling. If Jesus can
argue in that fashion, so can his followers, at the expense
of intellectual honesty.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Cannibalism" id="Cannibalism"></a>Cannibalism</p>

<p>The Jews could not understand what Jesus meant
when he said: "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of
man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.
Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath
eternal life."<a name="FNanchor_11_77" id="FNanchor_11_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_77" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p class="hd4"><a name="Religion_Only_for_Children" id="Religion_Only_for_Children"></a>Religion Only for Children</p>

<p>Nor are these sayings clear: "I thank thee, O Father,
Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these
things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed
them unto babes."<a name="FNanchor_12_78" id="FNanchor_12_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_78" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> "Whosoever shall not receive the
kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter
therein."<a name="FNanchor_13_79" id="FNanchor_13_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_79" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>This train of thought implies that education is of no
importance where belief is concerned.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Difficult_or_Easy" id="Difficult_or_Easy"></a>Difficult or Easy?</p>

<p>After enumerating the many hardships that must be
endured by his followers, Jesus contradicted himself by
saying, "For my yoke is easy, and my burden is
light."<a name="FNanchor_14_80" id="FNanchor_14_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_80" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Charity" id="Charity"></a>Charity</p>

<p>There are apparent contradictions in his instructions
regarding charity: "Let your light so shine before men,
that they may see your good works, and glorify your
Father which is in heaven."<a name="FNanchor_15_81" id="FNanchor_15_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_81" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> "Take heed that ye do
not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise

<p class="hd4"><a name="The_Scriptures_Upheld" id="The_Scriptures_Upheld"></a>The Scriptures Upheld</p>

<p>Jesus reverenced the Hebrew Old Testament.</p>

<p>"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the
prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For
verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one
jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till
all be fulfilled."<a name="FNanchor_17_83" id="FNanchor_17_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_83" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>And yet Jesus was the reformer, overthrowing ancient
customs, renouncing the old principle of a tooth
for a tooth, improving upon the Mosaic law. He was
inconsistent.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Illogical" id="Illogical"></a>Illogical</p>

<p>The logic of Jesus is often difficult to follow.</p>

<p>"And when he is come, he will reprove the world
of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: of sin
because they believe not on me; of righteousness, because
I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; of
judgment, because the prince of this world is judged."<a name="FNanchor_18_84" id="FNanchor_18_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_84" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Jesus admitted his obscurity: "These things have I
spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh,
when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but
I shall shew you plainly of the Father."<a name="FNanchor_19_85" id="FNanchor_19_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_85" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>That time has never come.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Parables_Deceptive" id="Parables_Deceptive"></a>Parables Deceptive</p>

<p>Jesus explained his obscurity in this way: "Unto you
it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might
not see, and hearing they might not understand."<a name="FNanchor_20_86" id="FNanchor_20_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_86" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
"But unto them that are without, all these things are
done in parables: that seeing they may see, and not
perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand;
lest at any time they should be converted, and
their sins should be forgiven them."<a name="FNanchor_21_87" id="FNanchor_21_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_87" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>In other words, Jesus, who said he came to save the
world, concealed his meaning for fear some of his
hearers should be converted and their sins be forgiven&mdash;which
is exactly what he sought to bring about.</p>

<p>Obscurity in a teacher is a great defect, especially
when he glories in his ambiguity. If any Christians
wish that Jesus had been more clear, then Jesus does
not appear perfect to them, and they should admit his
imperfections.</p>

<h2><a name="DEFICIENT_INSTRUCTIONS" id="DEFICIENT_INSTRUCTIONS"></a>DEFICIENT INSTRUCTIONS</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In a</span> number of instances the teachings of Jesus are
so incomplete, or so inappropriate, as to render no assistance
in meeting similar situations in modern life.
Either his meaning is not clear, or his instructions are
too primitive to be applicable to our civilization.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Labor" id="Labor"></a>Labor</p>

<p>The relation between employer and employee is one
that requires practical guidance. Let us see what information
Jesus gave on this important subject.</p>

<p>The parable of the laborers<a name="FNanchor_1_88" id="FNanchor_1_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_88" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> relates that an employer
hired men to work in his vineyard for twelve hours
for a penny, and that he paid the same wage to other
workers who toiled only nine, six, three and one hour.
When those who had worked longest resented this
treatment, as modern strikers would, the employer answered,
apparently with Jesus' approval: "Friend, I do
thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
penny? Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give
unto this last, even as unto thee. Is it not lawful for
me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye
evil, because I am good? So the last shall be first, and
the first last."</p>

<p>This parable may be a comfort to autocratic employers,
sustaining them in their determination to dominate
labor, but the principles enunciated are lacking in
social vision. Equal pay for unequal work is approved,
and the employer is vindicated in regulating wages and
hours as he sees fit without regard for justice or the
needs of the workers. In the manner of modern employers,
the "goodman" calls his worker "Friend" but
treats him with contempt. Jesus taught that the workers
were wrong in demanding justice, that the employer
was justified in acting erratically, as the money paid
was his. He presented the issues between capital and
labor and sided with capital. He stated the fact that the
first shall be last, but said nothing to remedy that unfortunate
situation. He did not explain how workers
could obtain proper compensation for their labor.</p>

<p>Jesus assumed a fair attitude when he said, "The
labourer is worthy of his hire", and, "It is enough for
the disciple to be as his master, and the servant as his
lord", but he continued with doubtful logic: "If they
have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how
much more shall they call them of his household", implying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
that if an employer is worldly-minded his servants
will be even worse.</p>

<p>Little respect is shown for employees in the remark,
"The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and
careth not for the sheep."<a name="FNanchor_2_89" id="FNanchor_2_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_89" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Probably in those days as
now many an employee stuck to his post nobly to do
his duty.</p>

<p>The meaning is obscure in his other comment upon
an employer who told his tired servant to serve his
master first, ending with the enigma, "We are unprofitable
servants: we have done that which was our
duty to do."<a name="FNanchor_3_90" id="FNanchor_3_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_90" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Usury" id="Usury"></a>Usury</p>

<p>In the parable of the talents the servant who did not
put his money out at usury to make profits was condemned:
"And cast ye the unprofitable servant into
outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of
teeth."<a name="FNanchor_4_91" id="FNanchor_4_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_91" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Punishment was to be severe in Jesus' program;
the disobedient servant "shall be beaten with
many stripes." Jesus did not advise leniency in such
instances except that "he that knew not, and did commit
things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few
stripes."<a name="FNanchor_5_92" id="FNanchor_5_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_92" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In his estimation the servant was a slave to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
be punished corporeally by his master, even if ignorant
of his wrong-doing.</p>

<p>A Dr. Taylor, former Yale College theologian, is
reported to have said: "I have no doubt that if Jesus
Christ were now on earth he would, under certain circumstances,
become a slaveholder." A Southern divine
in 1860 could well maintain that slavery was approved
in both Old and New Testaments, but no Christian
would now impute slaveholding to Jesus. The standard
of human relationships has improved since slaveholding
days in America. The modern attitude toward servants,
though by no means perfect, is superior to the relationships
between master and servants accepted by Jesus.
Slavery was the custom of the times and Jesus did not
rise above it.</p>

<p>In the parable of the unmerciful servant<a name="FNanchor_6_93" id="FNanchor_6_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_93" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Jesus
taught the duty of forgiveness. He rightly rebuked the
servant who oppressed his subordinates after being well
treated by his lord. But the punishment suggested by
Jesus for the abominable conduct was extremely harsh:
"And his lord was wroth and delivered him to the
tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto
him." Torture for criminals was thus taught by Jesus.</p>

<p>Jesus, apprenticed to his father in his youth, never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
did any practical work so far as we know. He lived on
the charity of others, setting an example that would
bring trouble to anyone who followed in his train. If
anything, he was an agitator, a peripatetic propagandist,
teaching what he believed right but not working to
support himself and therefore not being a good example
for the workaday world today.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Economics" id="Economics"></a>Economics</p>

<p>Nothing in the teachings of Jesus was more definite
than his denunciation of riches.</p>

<p>"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth ...
A rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of
heaven ... It is easier for a camel to go through the
eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the
kingdom of God ... The rich man also died, and
was buried; and in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in
torments ... Woe unto you that are rich."</p>

<p>These strictures upon the rich appear somewhat
severe, and Jesus went much farther, condemning even
ordinary thrift and precaution.<a name="FNanchor_7_94" id="FNanchor_7_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_94" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>According to Acts ii, 44-45 and iv, 32, "All that believed
were together and had all things common; and
sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
men, as every man had need ... Neither said any of
them that aught of the things which he possessed was
his own; but they had all things common."</p>

<p>It is to be presumed that the disciples practiced this
communism at the instruction of Jesus. If Jesus approved
of communism was he right or wrong?</p>

<p>"Blessed be ye poor."<a name="FNanchor_8_95" id="FNanchor_8_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_95" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Poverty is not a blessing but a curse. Jesus taught the
theory that the poor would be rich hereafter while the
rich would be in hell.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Punishment_for_Debts" id="Punishment_for_Debts"></a>Punishment for Debts</p>

<p>We have seen that Jesus expected an unjust servant
to be tormented until he paid in full. There are also
other evidences that he approved of imprisonment for
debt. "Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou
art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary
deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to
the officer, and thou be cast into prison. Verily I say
unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till
thou hast paid the uttermost farthing."<a name="FNanchor_9_96" id="FNanchor_9_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_96" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>A legislator who patterned his life after Jesus would
be justified in enacting laws imprisoning for debt and
scourging for misdemeanors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Some may say that the sentiments expressed by Jesus
were not mistakes but merely presented the customs of
his day. Possibly he did not intend to advise all that he
seemed to approve; but if Jesus was a practical and
prophetic guide he should have made it clear that he
did not sanction the actions he apparently commended.</p>

<p>In the parable of the pounds the nobleman, seemingly
with the approval of Jesus, denounced the servant
as wicked who did not put his lord's money in the bank
to draw interest.<a name="FNanchor_10_97" id="FNanchor_10_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_97" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> And in the parable of the talents the
lord rewarded those who had made 100 per cent profit
through speculation.<a name="FNanchor_11_98" id="FNanchor_11_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_98" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Another contradiction of his theory of the blessedness
of poverty was his promise that those who followed
him "shall receive a hundredfold now in this time,
houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and
children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world
to come eternal life."<a name="FNanchor_12_99" id="FNanchor_12_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_99" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Finally, Jesus stated the unfortunate truth, "Whosoever
hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have
more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him
shall be taken even that he hath."<a name="FNanchor_13_100" id="FNanchor_13_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_100" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> If Jesus did not
approve of that worldly method of distribution, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
could have denounced its injustice instead of leaving the
comment as if it expressed his own policy.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Healing" id="Healing"></a>Healing</p>

<p>Many Christians value Jesus most for his healing
powers, but Jesus looked upon disease almost as he did
upon demoniacal possession, as something evil that
could be cast out. "But that ye may know that the Son
of man hath power on earth to forgive sins (then saith
he to the sick of the palsy) Arise, take up thy bed, and
go into thine house."<a name="FNanchor_14_101" id="FNanchor_14_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_101" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> There was confusion in his
mind between sin and sickness.</p>

<p>Jesus healed leprosy and palsy by touching the sick
person; he healed the servant of the centurion by absent
treatment, and restored sight by spitting on the eyes<a name="FNanchor_15_102" id="FNanchor_15_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_102" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
or anointing them with clay made with spittle<a name="FNanchor_16_103" id="FNanchor_16_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_103" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>, or by
requiring faith.<a name="FNanchor_17_104" id="FNanchor_17_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_104" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> He healed a withered hand, cured impediments
in speech and deafness, all without medical
applications, even replacing an ear severed by a sword.<a name="FNanchor_18_105" id="FNanchor_18_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_105" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Christian Scientists practice the same methods with
confidence in success, but medical and surgical treatment
are the most reliable means of effecting cures, disappointing
as they are. If Jesus could cure disease, it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
remiss of him not to instruct men definitely in his
methods so that the suffering from illness that has
afflicted the world could have been averted.</p>

<p>Jesus did not isolate the germ of leprosy, or establish
any practicable method of preventing disease. He has
been of less value to the world as a healer than Pasteur,
Lister, Koch, or Walter Reed.</p>

<p>Some Christians will say that Jesus did not tell us
how to avoid illness because man needs to be chastened
by pain. If that is correct, if pain and disease are sent
by God and are consciously permitted by Jesus, sick
people should be allowed to suffer instead of trying to
heal them.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Peace" id="Peace"></a>Peace</p>

<p>Jesus has been called the Prince of Peace, but the
weight of his testimony is not on the side of absolute
pacifism. With his view of rendering unto Caesar the
things that are Caesar's, it is possible that he would
have advised young men to obey the state and enlist,
or accept the draft, whenever their country called.</p>

<p>On November 12, 1931, Rev. Dr. T. Andrew Caraker
said at a banquet of the American Legion in Baltimore
that if Jesus Christ had lived in 1917 He would
have been the first to volunteer in the American army,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the first to wear a gas mask, shoulder a rifle and enter
the trenches.</p>

<p>Other ministers derive from the same gospels the
belief that Jesus would not have stabbed Germans
with a bayonet. Nor would Jesus have advised others
to fight if he had been unwilling to fight himself.</p>

<p>Most of the sayings of Jesus regarding violence or
non-resistance were intended to apply chiefly to personal
relationships; he said little of international strife.
What he did say showed placid acceptance of the war
system:</p>

<p>"And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars:
see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must
come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall
rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_19_106" id="FNanchor_19_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_106" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>"And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of
wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs
be; but the end shall not be yet. For nation shall rise
against nation, and kingdom against kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_20_107" id="FNanchor_20_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_107" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>"But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be
not terrified: for these things must first come to pass;
but the end is not by and by. Then said he unto them,
Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_21_108" id="FNanchor_21_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_108" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>These verses have a more direct bearing on war as we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
now know it than any of his other sayings. They show
his belief in the inevitability of war. Apparently he did
not feel himself competent to counteract general mass
militarism. He offered no program for arbitration of
international disputes, no substitute for war between
nations, no policy of war resistance.</p>

<p>When Jesus advised non-resistance, saying to his follower,
"Put up again thy sword into his place: for
all they that take the sword shall perish with the
sword,"<a name="FNanchor_22_109" id="FNanchor_22_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_109" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> he was merely stating the danger of using
violence, not the immorality of employing force. In
fact, he commanded his disciples to take the very sword
which he later told them to sheathe: "He that hath no
sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one ... And
they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he
said unto them, It is enough."<a name="FNanchor_23_110" id="FNanchor_23_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_110" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Thus Jesus, the supposed non-resistant, prepared his
followers with swords. These swords were for defense,
and when the time came he repudiated even that use of
the weapons, but, nevertheless, he armed his disciples
instead of adhering to his principle of non-resistance.
He did not set a positive example of disarmament.</p>

<p>Jesus said: "Blessed are the peacemakers ... love
your enemies ... Have peace one with another ...<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
On earth peace, good will toward men ... Peace I
leave with you, my peace I give unto you ... These
things have I spoken unto you that in me ye might
have peace ... Resist not evil: but whosoever shall
smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other
also."</p>

<p>Other remarks of Jesus favored violence: "Think not
that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to
send peace, but a sword."<a name="FNanchor_24_111" id="FNanchor_24_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_111" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> "Suppose ye that I am
come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather
division."<a name="FNanchor_25_112" id="FNanchor_25_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_112" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> "But those mine enemies, which would
not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and
slay them before me."<a name="FNanchor_26_113" id="FNanchor_26_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_113" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> "My kingdom is not of this
world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would
my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the
Jews."<a name="FNanchor_27_114" id="FNanchor_27_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_114" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> "When a strong man armed keepeth his
palace, his goods are in peace: but when a stronger
than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he
taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and
divideth his spoils."<a name="FNanchor_28_115" id="FNanchor_28_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_115" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> "And when he had made a
scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the
temple."<a name="FNanchor_29_116" id="FNanchor_29_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_116" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>In determining whether or not Jesus was a promoter
of peace it is only reasonable to review everything that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
he said or did relating to the use of violence, giving
equal weight to every verse. We cannot accept one
statement and reject the others. The conclusion reached
must be that Jesus was inconsistent in advocating both
non-resistance and the use of force. He took diametrically
opposed positions, the use of swords and scourges
and non-resistance being mutually exclusive. Jesus
preached non-resistance and at the same time armed his
retainers with two swords. He advocated turning the
other cheek but did not criticize war. Therefore,
pacifists and militarists, with their opposite philosophies,
should both admit that at times Jesus was mistaken.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Marriage" id="Marriage"></a>Marriage</p>

<p>Jesus occasionally eulogized marriage: "For this
cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall
cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh ...
What therefore God hath joined together, let not
man put asunder."<a name="FNanchor_30_117" id="FNanchor_30_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_117" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Celibacy" id="Celibacy"></a>Celibacy</p>

<p>On other occasions he made remarks which indicated
his preference for celibacy as the higher state, the one
he adopted for himself. "In the resurrection they neither<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the
angels of God in heaven."<a name="FNanchor_31_118" id="FNanchor_31_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_118" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> "The children of this

looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed

sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it."<a name="FNanchor_34_121" id="FNanchor_34_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_121" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
"There is no man that hath left ... wife, or children
for the kingdom of God's sake, who shall not receive
manifold more in this present time, and in the world to
come life everlasting."<a name="FNanchor_35_122" id="FNanchor_35_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_122" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Jesus referred to the absence of marriage in heaven,
the ideal realm. Paul's testimony adds to the evidence
that Jesus considered celibacy preferable to any form
of sex expression, even marriage.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Adultery" id="Adultery"></a>Adultery</p>

<p>On the other hand, Jesus was tolerant of sex offenses.
He chatted in a friendly manner with the woman of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Samaria, saying: "Thou hast had five husbands; and he
whom thou now hast is not thy husband."<a name="FNanchor_36_123" id="FNanchor_36_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_123" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> And
about the woman taken in adultery he said: "He that
is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at
her ... Neither do I condemn thee: go and sin no
more."<a name="FNanchor_37_124" id="FNanchor_37_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_124" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> "The harlots go into the kingdom of God
before you."<a name="FNanchor_38_125" id="FNanchor_38_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_125" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Divorce" id="Divorce"></a>Divorce</p>

<p>Jesus sanctioned divorce. His followers are so annoyed
at this fact that they frequently quote the verse
on the subject with the offensive clause omitted. The
text reads: "It hath been said, Whosoever shall put
away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:
But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put
away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication,
causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall
marry her that is divorced committeth adultery."<a name="FNanchor_39_126" id="FNanchor_39_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_126" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Again in Matthew xix, 9, he makes the same exception.
It is evident, therefore, that Jesus permitted divorce
for one cause. If the wife was unfaithful the
husband could divorce her, but otherwise no matter
how unhappy the couple might be, they must remain
married.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>
<p>The admirable leniency of Jesus toward sex offenders,
and his permission to divorce, must seem like
mistakes to churchmen who consider extramarital sex
relations the unforgivable sin. And everyone must see
the danger of having our judges adopt as a principle of
justice the dismissal of offenders on the ground that the
prosecutors have also sinned.</p>

<p>A Christian girl of today would not be encouraged
by the most zealous religious parents to marry a man
exactly like Jesus.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Faulty_Judgment" id="Faulty_Judgment"></a>Faulty Judgment</p>

<p>Jesus selected Judas to be the treasurer of the apostles'
joint funds, but later admitted his error, saying: "Have
I not chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for it was
he that should betray him, being one of the twelve."<a name="FNanchor_40_127" id="FNanchor_40_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_127" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Jesus erroneously supposed that "salvation is of the
Jews."<a name="FNanchor_41_128" id="FNanchor_41_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_128" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> "Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and
into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: but go
rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."<a name="FNanchor_42_129" id="FNanchor_42_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_129" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> A
nationalistic and partial spirit is expressed in these
sentences, a spirit that has been followed to the extent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that Jesus would not be permitted to enter America if
he applied for a visa.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Unconvincing" id="Unconvincing"></a>Unconvincing</p>

<p>Jesus failed in his mission to save the world. He
made the supreme sacrifice in vain. His method of
proving his divinity did not convince his hearers: "But
though he had done so many miracles before them, yet
they believed not on him."<a name="FNanchor_43_130" id="FNanchor_43_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_130" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> "For neither did his
brethren believe in him."<a name="FNanchor_44_131" id="FNanchor_44_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_131" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> After he had healed many,
cast out unclean spirits and appointed his twelve
apostles to do likewise, his friends "went out to lay
hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself."<a name="FNanchor_45_132" id="FNanchor_45_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_132" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Jesus admitted his impotence as a human being when
he said, "I can of mine own self do nothing."<a name="FNanchor_46_133" id="FNanchor_46_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_133" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Even
with the assistance of his Father he did not accomplish
what he set out to do.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Prohibition" id="Prohibition"></a>Prohibition</p>

<p>The miracle of turning water into wine, providing
one hundred gallons of wine after the people at the
party had "well drunk", must appear to prohibitionists
like a mistake on the part of Jesus. Many Methodists<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and Baptists would have preferred to have him turn
the wine into water; yet they will not admit that Jesus
made a mistake.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Lack_of_Experience" id="Lack_of_Experience"></a>Lack of Experience</p>

<p>So far as the gospels relate, Jesus never had any experience
with three of the chief difficulties of human
life&mdash;sex, earning a living and illness. He was therefore
less able to explain those relationships than one who has
struggled through in the customary manner of mankind.
To take the inexperienced Jesus as our guide in
practical living would be like a traveller who was
planning a trip over perilous mountains and engaged
as a guide a man who had never crossed the mountains.</p>

<p>As Jesus believed that the end of the world was
approaching, and as he revealed no information about
the future, his teachings should be taken as applying
solely to his own time. A divinity living now would
preach far differently from the inadequate doctrines of
Jesus.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The abandonment of reliance upon a Jesus who has
not changed in nineteen hundred years, in favor of an
Evolutionary philosophy that requires constant change,
leads to a new conception of the world and its possibilities
for man. A person who has thought himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
out of antiquated theology may be expected to have
an open mind towards the betterment of human customs.</p>

<p>Every improvement in human relationships originates
secularly and is adopted by the Church only after
a bitter struggle. Faith in Jesus is a reactionary force.
The Christian opposes change in the creations of God;
the Evolutionist seeks to alter every unsatisfactory condition.
The Evolutionist is more responsive than the
orthodox Christian to proposals for promoting the happiness
of the human race. Many liberals have abandoned
conservatism because they saw the hypocrisy in
Christianity.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Orthodox</span> Christians accept both Old and New
Testaments as authority for their actions, whereas Modernists
are not much concerned with the commands of
Jehovah but maintain that Jesus is the pattern for their
lives. Religious liberals feel that the troubles of the
world come largely from failure to follow the teachings
of the Nazarene. They look upon him as the perfect
example of what a man should be. In their opinion,
if everyone would act as Jesus did all would be
well.</p>

<p>On December 7, 1931, Dr. Henry Van Dyke
preached at the Brick Presbyterian Church, New York
City, that the way to end the financial depression was
to act as Jesus would: "We can judge only by what he
did and said in the first century, an age not so different
from our own, an age of unsettlement, violence, drunkenness
and license. Christ would tell us not to yield
to panic.... Christ would not tell us to join any
political party or social group...."</p>

<p>Such a sermon sounds encouraging but, as a matter
of fact, Jesus has not shown any of his ministers how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to end the depression. To trust him for guidance in
our modern world is to pin faith on an incompetent
instructor. We can learn how to end the depression by
examining the records of our own time and by correcting
the errors that have been made. It is not safe
to rely upon a person who had no knowledge of America's
practical needs and whose acts and advice regarding
worldly affairs in Jerusalem fell short of the best
ethical values.</p>

<p>In this treatise it has been shown that Jesus made
mistakes. Every instance cited may not appeal to all
readers as worthy of criticism, but there can be no
doubt in the mind of any honest thinker that several at
least of Jesus' ideas were erroneous. His theology was
filled with superstitions, his cosmology was that of the
pre-scientific era, he expected the end of the world
within a generation, his conception of sin was theological
rather than ethical, he failed to convince his
hearers by his oratory, he exaggerated the results from
prayer and he related parables that gave a false sense of
values.</p>

<p>Now we shall turn to his personal character and
teachings to see if he was always the meek, gentle soul
portrayed by the conventional Christ.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Cursing_Nature" id="Cursing_Nature"></a>Cursing Nature</p>

<p>The act in Jesus' life that has been most difficult for
theologians to explain was the cursing of the fig tree.
The tree was created to bear fruit in the Summer, but
when Jesus found it without fruit in the Spring, he
cursed it so that it withered away.</p>

<p>"Now in the morning, as he returned into the city,
and when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it,
and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said
unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforth for ever.
And presently the fig tree withered away."<a name="FNanchor_1_134" id="FNanchor_1_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_134" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> "For the
time of figs was not yet."<a name="FNanchor_2_135" id="FNanchor_2_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_135" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>This episode involves several mistakes&mdash;ignorance
of the seasons; destruction of a profitable food-producing
tree; exhibition of temper when thwarted, and
giving false information regarding man's power to
effect physical changes by a curse.<a name="FNanchor_3_136" id="FNanchor_3_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_136" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>If Jesus acted unwisely in this one instance and was
right in all others, he is neither an infallible God nor a
perfect pattern for mankind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Forgiveness" id="Forgiveness"></a>Forgiveness</p>

<p>The conventional Jesus is emblematic of supreme
kindness and forgiveness, but in reality he was far from
lenient in many instances, nor did he advocate forgiveness
for certain offenses.</p>

<p>"Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee ...
tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear
the church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man and
a publican."<a name="FNanchor_4_137" id="FNanchor_4_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_137" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In the parable of Dives and Lazarus, Abraham was
represented as justified in not forgiving the rich man
tortured in hell, or even in saving the rich man's
brothers as requested by the victim of Jesus' policy of
punishment.</p>

<p>Again Jesus said: "Whosoever shall deny me before
men, him will I also deny before my Father."<a name="FNanchor_5_138" id="FNanchor_5_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_138" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> "Whosoever
shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath
never forgiveness."<a name="FNanchor_6_139" id="FNanchor_6_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_139" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>All the wicked were condemned by Jesus to eternal
punishment with no chance of forgiveness.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Vituperation" id="Vituperation"></a>Vituperation</p>

<p>Jesus was often vehement in his language to an extent
hardly compatible with gentleness of character.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"O generation of vipers! how can ye, being evil,

<p>"Woe unto you, hypocrites, for ye compass sea and

<p>"Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye
escape the damnation of hell?"<a name="FNanchor_9_142" id="FNanchor_9_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_142" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>"If I should say I know him not, I shall be a liar like
unto you."<a name="FNanchor_10_143" id="FNanchor_10_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_143" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>"All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers."<a name="FNanchor_11_144" id="FNanchor_11_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_144" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>"Ye fools and blind."<a name="FNanchor_12_145" id="FNanchor_12_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_145" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>This language may have been necessary, in Jesus'
opinion, to convince his hearers of their sins, but such
vituperation does not become a modern ethical teacher.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Destruction_of_Property" id="Destruction_of_Property"></a>Destruction of Property</p>

<p>Two acts of Jesus, consistent with his disregard of
worldly goods, were destructive in character.</p>

<p>"And there was a good way off from them a herd
of many swine feeding. So the devils besought him, saying,
If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the
herd of swine. And he said unto them, Go. And when
they were come out, they went into the herd of swine:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently
down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the
waters."<a name="FNanchor_13_146" id="FNanchor_13_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_146" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Jesus did what the devils requested, cruelly killing
two thousand inoffensive valuable animals that belonged
to other people.</p>

<p>"Jesus went up to Jerusalem, and found in the
temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and
the changers of money sitting: and when he had made
a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the
temple, and the sheep and the oxen; and poured out
the changers' money, and overthrew the tables."</p>

<p>Jesus has been defended for other acts on the ground
that he was living in less civilized times than our own,
but here he is seen offending both ancient and modern
sensibilities. The destruction of the swine and the routing
of the merchants were sensational and erratic exhibitions.
If reformers today should destroy herds of
animals, except to protect public health by due process
of law, or overthrow banks, they would be liable to
arrest in any city of Christendom. Therefore the consensus
of opinion denies exoneration to Jesus for his
spasmodic resort to direct action.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Egotism" id="Egotism"></a>Egotism</p>

<p>If Jesus was not God, but merely the ideal man, his
estimate of himself was excessive. In addition to his remarks
already quoted there are many other instances of
an exaggerated ego.</p>

<p>"If any man come to me, and hate not his father,
and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and
sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my
disciple."<a name="FNanchor_14_147" id="FNanchor_14_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_147" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>If Jesus was correct in claiming that he was the
Messiah, if he could control the elements and send people
to heaven or hell, he was justified in any extreme
remarks; but not if he were merely a man. Every person
is entitled to have as good an opinion of himself as his
character and ability warrant, but expressions of his own
worth are unseemly even if true, and are inexcusable if
exaggerated. As Jesus himself said (though this authority<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
is only for believers) testimony about oneself is unreliable.</p>

<p>Jesus not only claimed to be more than a man, he
threatened his hearers with death if they did not agree
with him. All of which might be permissible if he were
God, but was an egotistical illusion if he was merely
human.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Lack_of_Courtesy" id="Lack_of_Courtesy"></a>Lack of Courtesy</p>

<p>Jesus did not always exhibit the courtesy one would
expect of a gentleman, or even of a nature's nobleman.</p>

<p>The first instance of lack of consideration was when
he slipped away from his parents, causing them unnecessary
anxiety: "Son, why hast thou thus dealt
with us? behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing."<a name="FNanchor_20_153" id="FNanchor_20_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_153" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
He had remained behind to study Hebrew
theology and did not tell his parents, presumably because
he thought they would not have permitted the
venture.</p>

<p>Another instance was found in his daily life:</p>

<p>"A certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him:
and he went in, and sat down to meat. And when the
Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first
washed before dinner. And the Lord said unto him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup
and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening
and wickedness. Ye fools ..."<a name="FNanchor_21_154" id="FNanchor_21_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_154" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Jesus had not only failed to wash as was expected of
a guest, but defended his uncleanliness and abused his
host.</p>

<p>At another time Jesus was discourteous to his mother:</p>

<p>"And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus
saith unto him, They have no wine. Jesus saith unto
her, Woman, what have I to do with thee?"<a name="FNanchor_22_155" id="FNanchor_22_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_155" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Jesus was apparently annoyed at his mother's interference,
though he followed her suggestion. He did not
set a good example for children in addressing their
mothers.</p>

<p>When the Syrophenician woman asked him to help
her daughter, "Jesus saith unto her, Let the children
first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's
bread, and to cast it unto the dogs. And she answered
and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the
table eat of the children's crumbs. And he said unto
her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out
of thy daughter."<a name="FNanchor_23_156" id="FNanchor_23_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_156" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Jesus practically admitted that he had made a mistake
in speaking unkindly to a Gentile. Her clever answer
induced him to change his decision. A physician<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
who called a stranger's child a dog would now be considered
brutal even in a free hospital.</p>

<p>"And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord,
suffer me first to go and bury my father. But Jesus said
unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their
dead."<a name="FNanchor_24_157" id="FNanchor_24_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_157" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Jesus could have allowed the man to attend his
father's funeral and follow him later. Would not that
have set a better precedent?</p>

<p>When Peter intervened to protect Jesus, the latter
"turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me,
Satan: thou art an offence unto me."<a name="FNanchor_25_158" id="FNanchor_25_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_158" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Even though Jesus was determined to go on with the
sacrifice, he could have been more appreciative of his
best friend's suggestion.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Unethical_Advice" id="Unethical_Advice"></a>Unethical Advice</p>

<p>When the unjust steward cheated his employer, Jesus
gave the following remarkable advice:</p>

<p>"And the lord commended the unjust steward, because
he had done wisely: for the children of this world
are in their generation wiser than the children of light.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the
mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they
may receive you into everlasting habitations."<a name="FNanchor_26_159" id="FNanchor_26_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_159" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>This passage should be read again before deciding
whether Jesus advised opportunism rather than morality.
The words must be taken as they are; no interpretation
can be based upon the assumption that Jesus was
always right and therefore meant something different
from what he said.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Sermon_on_the_Mount" id="Sermon_on_the_Mount"></a>Sermon on the Mount</p>

<p>Many Christians say that they care nothing for
theology; that the Sermon on the Mount contains all
that is necessary for a religious life, being a perfect system
of ethics.</p>

<p>The Sermon on the Mount does contain many admirable
principles, but also some that are inferior to
present standards. Few of the people who praise this
Sermon would think it proper to abide by all the teachings
therein. Christian parents do not wish their children
to follow either the letter or the spirit of this
famous preachment. It begins in the fifth chapter of
Matthew.</p>

<p>"Blessed are the poor in spirit." Is it better to be
poor in spirit than rich and eager in spirit? Being poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
in spirit is to be faint of heart. This is bad advice, is it
not?</p>

<p>"Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted."
This means that those who mourn on earth
will be comforted in heaven; but now that life on earth
has assumed greater importance, so far as our daily conduct
is concerned, than life in heaven, the philosophy
of gloom is unfortunate. Jesus preached acceptance of
unhappiness as the common lot of man; he should not
therefore be credited with providing happiness on earth.
His urge to rejoice was usually in anticipation of good
things to come in the next world. He preached sorrow
for all here rather than the greater happiness for the
greater number.</p>

<p>"There shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes
in divers places. All these are the beginning of
sorrows. Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted,
and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations
for my name's sake ... and because iniquity shall
abound, the love of many shall wax cold. But he that
shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved."<a name="FNanchor_27_160" id="FNanchor_27_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_160" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>"Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh."<a name="FNanchor_28_161" id="FNanchor_28_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_161" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The beatitude, "Blessed are the meek: for they shall
inherit the earth" is of doubtful accuracy or value.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>The commands to pluck out an eye or cut off a hand
may not have been intended literally, although it does
appear as if Jesus referred to the physical body, and
men have often so interpreted these doubtful instructions.</p>

<p>Jesus said that "Whosoever shall marry her that is
divorced committeth adultery", which is no longer true.
Those who permit remarriage after divorce should admit
an error on Jesus' part.</p>

<p>"But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil." This
instruction should be reversed, should it not? Evil
should be resisted in every possible way that does not
involve evil in itself. What modern ethical teacher will
say that evil should not be resisted, or that this advice
of Jesus was perfection? If his instruction was intended
to refer to physical resistance, then no righteous person
should fight in any war, no police should be delegated
to arrest criminals. If the phrase has merely a spiritual
meaning, it is certainly unsound advice, for evil should
be overcome by good.</p>

<p>A fanatical attitude towards the law was recommended
when Jesus said: "If any man will sue thee at
the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy
cloak also." Extreme generosity and non-resistance are
taught, but the illustration was not well thought out,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
for if the man had already won his suit and taken the
coat, it is evident that the owner of the coat had put
up a legal fight instead of giving away his coat and cloak
as Jesus implies he should. Yielding more than a legal
opponent wins in court is not compatible with defending
the suit, nor is it a principle that would meet the
approval of most of Jesus' followers today.</p>

<p>"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which
is in heaven is perfect." If Jesus referred to Jehovah as
his Father in heaven, the standard of perfection advocated
was very low, for Jehovah was, as Thomas Jefferson
put it, "cruel, vindictive, capricious and unjust."</p>

<p>The Lord's Prayer is not the simple, clear, devotional
petition that is usually supposed. Take it literally, as
was undoubtedly intended, and its irrelevance to actual
life is at once apparent.</p>

<p>"Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy
name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth,
as it is in heaven." This is a proper invocation only if
there is a heaven in which God's will is done. None
such has been discovered.</p>

<p>"Give us this day our daily bread" indicates that
God would not give our daily sustenance without being
asked, whereas there is no apparent distinction in actual
living between those who pray for bread and those who
do not.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our
debtors" intimates that divine forgiveness is not to be
superior to that of men.</p>

<p>"And lead us not into temptation"&mdash;as if God were
anxious to lead us there and would be deterred by our
prayer.</p>

<p>It may seem like petty cavil to criticize the prayer
that has been acclaimed for many centuries as ideal, but,
seriously, what valuable principle for guidance through
life does the Lord's Prayer contain? Do its requests
represent the best modern conception of prayer as an
inward aspiration rather than as petitionary? Is it not
vain repetition to recite it again and again?</p>

<p>The general idea of offering prayer in order to obtain
various needs presents the difficulty of reconciling the
conception of an omnipotent, all-foreseeing God with
the contradictory theory of a Father who requires prayer
before caring for his children, an almighty God who
will be turned from his course by human petitions. Man
can do wonders in the way of conquering nature, but
he has not been able to alter natural laws, nor is there
any evidence that such laws have been changed at any
time in answer to prayer.</p>

<p>If the Lord's Prayer is not essential for man's welfare
in the world, we may conclude that Jesus over-emphasized
its importance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most important portions of the Sermon
on the Mount is the advice regarding worldly possessions.
Nothing in the teaching of Jesus is more definite
than his instructions regarding wealth. He strikes an
admirable note when he says, "What is a man profited
if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul? ...
A man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the
things which he possesseth." This general principle is
sadly needed in the modern money-seeking world, but
the teachings of Jesus on economics go much further,
far beyond anything the best people of today are willing
to follow.</p>

<p>"Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or
what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye
shall put on ... Take therefore no thought for the
morrow."<a name="FNanchor_29_162" id="FNanchor_29_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_162" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>These commands, taken literally as Jesus intended,
would lead to infinite trouble. Men are obliged to take
thought for the morrow; if they do not they will fail to
survive. In Jesus' plan provision for the earthly future
was of no importance because of the imminence of
eternal life, but now it is considered one's duty to provide
for old age.</p>

<p>This mistake of Jesus cannot be explained away by
saying that Jesus was right and that man falls short of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the counsel of perfection given by the Master. No, there
are few indeed who will say that it would be right to
shape their financial life as Jesus advised. If they do not
believe it right to follow his instructions, definite as
they are on this subject, they must admit that he was
wrong. Either thrift is now unrighteous, or Jesus is not
a dependable guide for modern life.</p>

<p>The following instructions have little meaning now
except for Roman Catholics. "But thou, when thou
fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face, that thou
appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which
is in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret shall
reward thee openly."</p>

<p>Another portion of the Sermon holds out false hopes
that cannot be substantiated: "For everyone that asketh
receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth." Is there any
virtue in thus deceiving the people regarding the possibilities
of prayer?</p>

<p>"Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men
should do to you, do ye even so to them." This is the
famous Golden Rule that has been heralded as one of
the most original portions of Jesus' teachings. But Jesus
admitted that he did not first state this rule when he
said, "for this is the law and the prophets."<a name="FNanchor_30_163" id="FNanchor_30_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_163" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>
<p>Confucius, born in 551 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, several times announced
the rule, "What you do not like when done to yourself,
do not to others." This negative statement is less effective
than the Jewish rule, but both are admirable regardless
of who first formulated them. The Golden
Rule is as valuable coming from the Hebrew fathers as
if Jesus had originated it.</p>

<p>The Golden Rule, however, is not perfect. It is one
of the best rules of the ancients, showing the desirability
of reciprocity, but it does not demand that our desires
be always just, nor does it insure that what we
want done to ourselves will always be what others most
need. It would be consistent with the Golden Rule for a
convivial man to entertain his prohibition friends at a
speakeasy, or for a Catholic to take his atheist guests to
daily mass. Possibly an even better rule than judging
others by ourselves would be to do unto others what
best pleases them.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Inconsistency" id="Inconsistency"></a>Inconsistency</p>

<p>"The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but
woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed!
it had been good for that man if he had not
been born."<a name="FNanchor_31_164" id="FNanchor_31_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_164" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>
<p>Apparently the arrangement between Jehovah and
Jesus was that Jesus should not give himself up as a
sacrifice voluntarily but should be betrayed by someone
else; and yet, although the betrayal was desired, the
man who assisted was to be condemned.</p>

<p>The sacrificial plan for salvation was continued to the
end in order that "the Scriptures of the prophets might
be fulfilled."<a name="FNanchor_32_165" id="FNanchor_32_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_165" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The scriptures were Jewish, so this is
additional proof that Jesus, rejected by the Jews, considered
himself the predicted Jewish Messiah. While
the Jews expected a Messiah, there is no clear prediction
of Jesus in the Old Testament.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Fear" id="Fear"></a>Fear</p>

<p>Jesus said, "Be not afraid of them that kill the
body"; but when threatened with bodily injury himself,
he was afraid. "Then took they up stones to cast
at him: but Jesus hid himself."<a name="FNanchor_33_166" id="FNanchor_33_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_166" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> "Then the Pharisees
went out, and held a council against him, how they
might destroy him. But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew
himself from thence."<a name="FNanchor_34_167" id="FNanchor_34_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_167" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>This avoidance of physical injury may have been due
to a desire to postpone his end until the proper time,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
as indicated by "Mine hour is not yet come", but
when the time did come, Jesus did not bear his approaching
death bravely, as Socrates did when about to
drink the cup of hemlock. Jesus was much afraid, "and
prayed, saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this
cup from me: nevertheless, not my will but thine be
done."<a name="FNanchor_35_168" id="FNanchor_35_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_168" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>He was resolved to go through with the painful experience
at any cost but was much more frightened than
many a mortal man, though he had a greater cause to
sustain him than martyrs who have suffered uncomplainingly;
for he believed that his sacrifice would save
the world: "and there appeared an angel unto him from
heaven, strengthening him. And being in an agony he
prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were
great drops of blood falling down to the ground."<a name="FNanchor_36_169" id="FNanchor_36_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_169" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>After saying, "The hour is come, that the Son of
man should be glorified ... He that loveth his life shall
lose it", he again showed terror: "Now is my soul
troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from
this hour, but for this cause came I unto this hour."<a name="FNanchor_37_170" id="FNanchor_37_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_170" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>It is to be noted that God did not answer the prayer
of Jesus, though Jesus had said that God would always
answer prayers in his name. Jesus recognized his failure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to obtain the answer, saying on the cross, "My God,
my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"<a name="FNanchor_38_171" id="FNanchor_38_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_171" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Failure" id="Failure"></a>Failure</p>

<p>Many a good man is a failure from a worldly point
of view, but failure is not what one would wish to copy.
Jesus sought to save the world. Surely no one looking
at the world today can say that he succeeded. His plan
of salvation was a failure; it did not work out as Jehovah
and Jesus intended. An ideal teacher is needed now
almost as much as two thousand years ago. If the world
is gradually improving, as seems probable, it is in spite
of the superstitions of the past, not because of them.</p>

<p>At one time Jesus denied his own perfection, saying:
"Why callest thou me good? there is none good but
one, that is, God."<a name="FNanchor_39_172" id="FNanchor_39_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_172" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Christian parents who hold Jesus up to their children
as a paragon would not wish their sons to grow
up to be just like Jesus. He is not an acceptable prototype.</p>

<p>Jesus did not provide the knowledge so much needed
by man to enable him to shape his course through life.
No one knows how to live correctly, how best to meet
each situation, what action is suited to the occasion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Jesus did not tell us what to do. His sayings are interpreted
in many different ways. He failed to predict the
needs of the future.</p>

<p>Jesus did not explain relations between man and wife,
nor between employer and employee, nor how to educate
children, nor how to preserve health, nor how to
make a living, nor how to prevent war, poverty and
suffering. Jesus gave little practical information, and his
spiritual advice was not clearly enough expressed to enable
man to apply it to modern conditions. Jesus
neglected to instruct people how to live. His knowledge
of the world was less than that of the average American
citizen.</p>

<h2><a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION"></a>CONCLUSION</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> historicity of Jesus has been discussed in many
books and pamphlets. Whether Jesus lived or not depends
upon what is meant by that phrase. If one is
satisfied that there was a peripatetic philosopher named
Jesus who was the son of a woman named Mary and
who lived and taught around Jerusalem, uttering some,
but not all, of the words attributed to him, then Jesus
may be said to have lived. There can be no serious objection
to the acceptance of that Jesus as an actual personage
even though he was ignored by secular historians
and though the time and place of his birth and death
are in doubt.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if there never was such a person
as the Jesus described in the New Testament&mdash;a man
born of a virgin, superior to natural laws, able to walk
on the water, and change the course of nature, performing
miracles, casting out devils, a man who never erred,
who was crucified, rose from the dead and ascended
bodily into heaven where he now sits to judge the world&mdash;if
there was no such man-God as the Jesus of the
gospels, some may hesitate to say that Jesus ever lived.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Jesus_a_Myth" id="Jesus_a_Myth"></a>Jesus a Myth</p>

<p>Sincere Evolutionists who discredit miracles, must
needs consider the gospel Jesus as a myth. This does not
mean that Jesus had no reality, but that the original
facts have been so enlarged upon that the principal features
of his life are more fanciful than real. If you eliminate
from the life of Jesus as unhistorical his birth, his
miracles, his theological teachings, his resurrection, ascension
and messianic mission, the Christ no longer exists.
Jesus would have attracted no attention were it not
for the very circumstances which Modernists admit
were mythical.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Judged_by_His_Works" id="Judged_by_His_Works"></a>Judged by His Works</p>

<p>Whether Jesus was God, or man, or myth, he can be
judged by his works, as he himself recommended. If
he is found to be perfect in word and deed, it makes
little difference whether he lived or not. As a symbol he
can be revered and copied. But if Jesus is now seen
to be the product of his times, representing the virtues
and defects of his biographers, with no vision beyond
their ken, his authority is gone.</p>

<p>Not only will the divinity of Jesus be discredited if
he was found to have been occasionally in error, but his
value as a guide to life will be impaired. What will be
the result of this radical change? None of the beautiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
ideals or sound ethical principles attributed to Jesus will
be lost. Not one saying or counsel of valuable advice
need go. Not one evil thought need take the place of
that which was good. In fact, the finest qualities of existence
will be more vital in our lives when their realization
becomes of primary importance instead of being
subordinate to worship of the supernatural. Principles
are superior to persons. A dead personality remains unchanged;
live ethical principles can be developed by
more complete knowledge of evolutionary processes.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Ethical_Evolution" id="Ethical_Evolution"></a>Ethical Evolution</p>

<p>Evolution has been progressing along ethical as well
as physical lines. To the teachings of Jesus, once considered
perfection, have been added many newly discovered
principles of value, for knowledge is cumulative.
All the best thoughts of the ages are ours forever, no
matter who first originated or expressed them.</p>

<p>Whatever the plan of the universe may be, it is
more nearly comprehended now than in Jesus' time.
Twentieth century events are more dependable in forming
our philosophy of life than those of the first century.
The failure to grasp this fact is the death knell
of orthodox religion. Every existing religious sect has
founded its spirituality upon events supposed to have
occurred in the past. Christianity depends upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
direct creation, fall of man and life of an atoning Savior,
all physical in character. Our new metaphysics will be
based upon conditions existing today and that will be
revealed by science in the future. The geologists, embryologists,
biologists and astronomers of 1932 have
more information about nature than Jesus had. On that
knowledge can be founded a system of living superior
to the Sermon on the Mount.</p>

<p>Our own time is the most dependable era of revelation.
We can safely accept whatever stands accredited
after thorough examination, including all teachings of
Jesus that are admirable. A modern person with religious
zeal has confidence that the world is ordered
along consistent lines and will respond favorably to
man's best efforts to solve the true way of living. The
scientific mind and the religious spirit are complementary.
Religion, instead of being a system of handed-down
sanctity, may become an inspired revelation to
each individual&mdash;a religion of the spirit of the modern
world.</p>

<p>As the spirit derived from Truth is superior to that
based upon credulity, the new doctrines that supplant
the old may be expected to excel any that have preceded
them. Anyone may be as spiritual as the proved
facts permit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>If the world has been improving physically and
ethically, we can have confidence that whatever knowledge
is necessary for our salvation is available to each of
us now. No living God has died; no great principle has
been lost. Instead of depending upon Jesus in an unthinking
manner, we must seek the Truth wherever it
is found and follow wherever it may lead regardless of
consequences. This requires more courage than professing
Jesus, whose teachings can be construed to mean
whatever the reader desires. While the majority regard
Jesus as an ascetic, a reformer, opposed to business and
joviality, Bruce Barton has convinced thousands that
Jesus was the great business man, rotarian and advertiser.</p>


<p class="hd4"><a name="Gains_not_Losses" id="Gains_not_Losses"></a>Gains, not Losses</p>

<p>Among the compensations that may supplant the
loss of Jesus as an ideal are the thrill at being a pioneer
in striving for the welfare of the human race rather
than for individual salvation; the satisfaction at having
a consistent creed that can be maintained against all
criticism without hypocrisy or evasion; emancipation
from inhibitions required by a supposedly divine teacher.
Every pleasure is not a sin, but rejection of theology
does not imply indifference to evil. Science warns
against excess as strongly as any ancient command. The
fear of natural or man-decreed punishment in this world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
is as potent as the dread of eternal torment threatened
by Jesus.</p>

<p>If Jesus really was the sort of personage described in
the Bible; if he really was born of a virgin, controlled
the elements and had power to condemn unbelievers to
eternal damnation, all people should obey his every
word. He should be followed literally; we should sell
all our possessions and take no thought for the morrow.
But if Jesus was not that sort of a person; if he was
neither a supernatural God nor an infallible man, he
should not be worshipped as a redeeming Savior nor be
followed as a true guide for human conduct.</p>

<p>Our faith shifts with careful examination of the
scriptures from belief in Jesus to confidence that the
world is a far pleasanter abode than Jesus imagined.
Without reliance upon the authority of Jesus we can
adopt a code which will prove comparatively effective
in leading towards a wholesome life.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CODE_OF_LIVING" id="CODE_OF_LIVING"></a>CODE OF LIVING</h2>


<p>1. Keep the body strong that the most efficient work
may be done, the greatest happiness obtained during
life and a wholesome inheritance passed on to future
generations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Cultivate the mind, learning as many important
facts as possible, striving to become expert in some
particular field of endeavor.</p>

<p>3. Develop a scientific spirit, the essential characteristic
of which is a search for Truth in the light of
evidence and reason. Do not deceive yourself or others.</p>

<p>4. Base your spiritual concepts on the latest developments
of Evolution. Be prepared to change your philosophy
to conform to the consensus of scientific opinion.</p>

<p>5. Conduct all human relationships in a spirit of
tolerance and love, having proper consideration for
others, not presuming to control their lives.</p>

<p>6. Treat the opposite sex honorably, respecting their
complementary qualities, with due regard for succeeding
generations.</p>

<p>7. Endeavor to embody in the laws of the community
the spirit of equity and progress.</p>

<p>8. Strive for an economic system under which each
individual shall be rewarded according to his or her value to society.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>9. Avoid the use of physical force for personal revenge
or national aggrandizement, having learned from
experience that reason triumphs while brutality degrades.</p>

<p>10. Hold yourself in readiness to accept new revelations.</p>

<p>Luther Burbank wrote concerning the above code on
November 11, 1925:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>I am greatly pleased with your code of living
... The false ancient theology has past or is
rapidly passing with intelligent people at the present
time. It is not applicable to our conditions and
is of no more value than a worn-out suit of
clothes.</i>"</p></div>
